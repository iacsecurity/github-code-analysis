# github-code-analysis

In order to analyze the IaC market, we wanted to do some basic analysis of code in GitHub. This repo contains the code that was used to do this. This code is not production grade, and was originally written by a programmer who has a limited experience in Python (@yi2020), so excuse the quality please. Anyone is welcome to improve the quality of this code, add tests, etc.

## Contributing

Right now the need is for people to review the code, see that it's correctly identifying different IaC technologies and improve the resilience of the code.
It's also possible to add more IaC languages to identify. We need to find a way to do it in a manner that doesn't require re-executing all the searches for the existing IaC languages.
