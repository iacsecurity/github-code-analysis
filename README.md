# github-code-analysis

In order to analyze the IaC market, we wanted to do some basic analysis of code in GitHub. This repo contains the code that was used to do this. This code is not production grade, and was originally written by a programmer who has a limited experience in Python (@yi2020), so excuse the quality please. Anyone is welcome to improve the quality of this code, add tests, etc.
